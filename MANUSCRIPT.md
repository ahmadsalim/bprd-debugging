Let us start with a small fact of life:
* While preparing this tutorial, I spend more time debugging than coding

Talk about docker/kitematic, docker attach, etc.

Talk about script and logging sessions.

Show tracing macros.

Debug errors in quicksort, binary search and plot sine:

Plot sine:
Missing + 10 in floor.
Use TRACE all around.

Quicksort:
Off by one error (+1, -1 switched in first recursive call).

Queue:
Dequeue doesn't check for empty

Run fbinfer on some of the example inputs.
